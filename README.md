After downloading the design files inside this repository, please build out the design using HTML5, SASS, and Twitter Bootstrap 4. Use your best judgement to create a responsive webpage that looks good for mobile devices, tablets, and desktop screens. We have provided XD and PSD files for you to use either Adobe Experience Design or Adobe Photoshop. 

Fonts are Playfair Display and Lato, both of which can be found on Google Fonts.
